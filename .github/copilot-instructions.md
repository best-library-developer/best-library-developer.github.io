This workspace contains a .NET 8 class library for sine signal modulation and a Blazor WebAssembly app that demonstrates the library and visualizes results.
Library should be used for signal processing tasks, and the Blazor app should provide a user-friendly interface for visualization.
The Blazor app references the library and displays sine signal processing results on a dedicated page with charts.
There should be a button to generate a sine signal, and the results should be displayed in a chart format using Chart.js.
The Blazor app should be able to run independently and should not require any additional configuration beyond the standard .NET setup.
Ensure that the Blazor app is set as the startup project in the solution.
There should be a button to stop the signal generation, and the app should handle any exceptions gracefully.
The Blazor app should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
The solution should be built using .NET 8, and all projects should be compatible with this version.
The Blazor app should include a simple user interface with clear instructions on how to use the signal processing features.
